# Model Car Project

## Introduction

#### This is the prototype project to train a end-to-end model for model car

## File Structure
### The master branch reorganized the file structure as follows:
1. Arduino/ -- the arduino source codes
2. Keras-model/ -- the deep learning framework running on jestson TX2
3. ros/ -- ros related codes -> need to put in /catkin_ws/src
4. model_car/ -- The model car source codes adapted from Karl Zipser's kzpy3.1

## Pre-install requirement for ROS on both TX2 and Desktop is in ros/



#### The original source codes could be found at https://github.com/karlzipser/kzpy3.1 and https://github.com/izeki/model_car
